          In the settlement of Sinoni, which is close to Arusha Town, is where Umoja Maonos offices are situated. It is situated between the two schools that have already been constructed. Joseph, the creator of UM, makes extensive use of the area. Being in the core of the village gives him the opportunity to be easily accessed by residents and other villages as he is an obvious agent of change in his community. The headquarters is utilised for meetings with parents who wish to enrol their kids in schools as well as meetings with other community members who need assistance starting up various businesses. Despite its size, the space is useful. I remember my first observation of the space, I did not imagine that all business operations could be conducted within the space available. It goes to show that it does not matter the size of the space, it matters the difference you are making with that said space
