            Qaim eagerly showed me around the school, pointing out all the
            improvements that had been made. The classrooms were bright and
            welcoming, filled with educational materials and resources. But what
            impressed me the most was how this school had become
            self-sustainable. Qaim explained to me that the NGO had not only
            built the physical infrastructure but also focused on capacity
            building for the teachers. They had provided training and support to
            enhance their skills and knowledge. As a result, these teachers were
            now equipped with the tools they needed to provide quality education
            to the children.

            Furthermore, the NGO had introduced a new curriculum that aligned
            with that of neighboring countries. This meant that the students
            would be learning in a way that was not only relevant to their own
            community but also prepared them for further education outside their
            region. It was incredible to see how this collaboration had opened
            up new opportunities for these children, breaking down barriers and
            widening their horizons. This school was more than just a building;
            it was a symbol of hope and progress. The efforts of the NGO had
            transformed it into a place where children could dream big and
            achieve their goals. I felt privileged to witness firsthand how
            capacity building and innovative curriculum could make such a
            significant difference in the lives of these young learners.
